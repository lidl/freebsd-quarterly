The TrueOS project has been working on a Package Base implementation,
and is pleased to issue its first [CFT to the FreeBSD
community](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-pkgbase/2019-April/000396.html).

The TrueOS packaging work has been in development for close to 6
months, and differs from the original FreeBSD package base effort,
in that it is an "out of tree" implementation. It allows any version
of FreeBSD to be packaged, and only requires a [patch to
poudriere](https://github.com/freebsd/poudriere/pull/664), as well
as some minor ports enhancements, the first which is [currently in
review](https://reviews.freebsd.org/D20055). For more information
on the current status, please refer to the FAQ page.

Additionally there will be a [working-group at BSDCan
2019](https://wiki.freebsd.org/DevSummit/201905/PackageBase), and
we encourage porters to attend and join the discussion.
