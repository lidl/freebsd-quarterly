## AXP803 PMIC driver update ##

Contact: Ganbold Tsagaankhuu, <ganbold@FreeBSD.org>  

The AXP803 is a highly integrated PMIC that targets Li-battery
(Li-ion or Li-polymer) applications. It provides flexible power
management solution for processors such as the Allwinner A64 SoC.
This SoC is used by Pinebook (https://www.pine64.org/?page_id=3707)

The following updates were performed on the AXP803 driver:

  * Enabled necessary bits when activating interrupts. This allows
    reading some events from the interrupt status registers. These
    events are reported to devd via system "PMU" and subsystem
    "Battery", "AC" and "USB" such as plugged/unplugged, battery
    absent, charged and charging.
  * Added sensors support for AXP803/AXP813. Sensor values such as
    battery charging, charge state, voltage, charging current,
    discharging current, battery capacity can be obtained via sysctl.
  * Added sysctl for setting battery charging current. The charging
    current can be set using steps from 0 to 13.  These steps
    correspond to 200mA to 2800mA, with a granularity of 200mA/step.
