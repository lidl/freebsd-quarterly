Ports activity in this quarter where:

* The x11-toolkits/gtk30 port updated to 3.24.5 and later to 3.24.7.
* The www/webkit2-gtk3 port was updated to 2.24.0.
* And the old insecure webkit-gtk2 and webkit-gtk3 where finally removed.

Work in progress, the branches are available in the GNOME development
repo, see the link above.

* Eric Turgeon is working on MATE 1.22 in the [mate-1.22] branch.
  And is almost complete.
* Charlie Li (IRC: vishwin) is working on a long overdue update of
  the cinnamon desktop.  This update is almost complete. The only
  real blocker is that the screensaver can't be unlocked after it
  activates. The work is in the [cinnamon] branch.

* Koop Mast works on GNOME 3.32. The desktop is usable apart from
  gdm which is currently non-functional. Due to lack of free time
  the work is going slowly. This work is available in the [gnome-3.32]
  branch.

People who are willing to contribute can find us on #freebsd-gnome
on freenode.
