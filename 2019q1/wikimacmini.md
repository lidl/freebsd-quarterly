The FreeBSD Wiki page for the Apple Intel Mac minis has been
comprehensively updated over the last quarter to drag it from 2009
into 2019.

There are now detailed instructions for installing FreeBSD as the
only operating system on models from 2007 through 2014 and itemised
model specific information detailing FreeBSD support.

If anyone is interested, help is needed to provide more specific
information for the macmini 1,1 and 6,1 through 8,1 models and to
test patches for the asmc(4) driver for temperature sensor feedback
and for setting fan speed. If you would like to help and have access
to these Mac minis, please contact me.

Future tasks:

  * Create and test more patches for asmc(4) to cover all Intel Mac minis
  * Provide more information for 2006, 2012, 2014 and 2018 Mac minis
  * Instructions for dual boot (macOS/FreeBSD) installations
