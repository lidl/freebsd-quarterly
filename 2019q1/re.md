The FreeBSD Release Engineering Team is responsible for setting and
publishing release schedules for official project releases of
FreeBSD, announcing code freezes and maintaining the respective
branches, among other things.

During the first quarter of 2019, the FreeBSD Release Engineering team
published the initial schedule for the upcoming the 11.3-RELEASE.

FreeBSD 11.3-RELEASE will be the fourth release from the *stable/11*
branch, building on the stability and reliability of 11.2-RELEASE.
FreeBSD 11.3-RELEASE is currently targed for release in early July, 2019.

Additionally throughout the quarter, several development snapshots builds
were released for the *head*, *stable/12*, and *stable/11* branches.

Much of this work was sponsored by the FreeBSD Foundation.
