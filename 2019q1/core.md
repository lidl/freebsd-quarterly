## FreeBSD Core Team ##

Contact: FreeBSD Core Team, <core@FreeBSD.org>  

The FreeBSD Core Team is the governing body of FreeBSD.

Core initiated a *Release Engineering Charter Modernization* working
group.  The purpose of the working group is to present (to Core) a
modernized version of the *Release Engineering Charter* and a first
version of a new *Release Engineering Team Operations Plan*.  The
group hopes to complete its goals and dissolve by 2019-06-30.

The Core Team invites all members of the FreeBSD community to
complete the *2019 FreeBSD Community Survey*.

https://www.research.net/r/freebsd2019

The purpose of the survey is to collect quantitative data from the
public in order to help guide the project's priorities and efforts.
It will remain open for 17 days and close at midnight May 13 UTC
(Monday 5pm PDT).

Core voted to approve source commit bits for Johannes Lundberg
(johalun@) and Mitchell Horne (mhorne@) and associate membership
for Philip Jocks.  Core also voted to revoke Michael Dexter's
documentation bit.

After a long lapse of not closing idle source commit bits, core has
taken in the commit bit for these developers.  We thank each for
contributing to the project as a source committer.
